CPU Usage Monitoring:

The script uses the top command to retrieve CPU usage statistics and calculates the percentage of CPU usage by subtracting idle CPU time from 100%.
If CPU usage exceeds the threshold, it logs an alert message.
Memory Usage Monitoring:

The free command is used to get memory statistics, and the script calculates the percentage of used memory (used/total * 100).
If memory usage exceeds the threshold, it logs an alert message.
Disk Usage Monitoring:

The df -h command lists the disk usage for all mounted file systems.
The script checks if any disk usage exceeds the specified threshold and logs an alert message if it does.
Running Processes Monitoring:

The ps aux --no-headers command lists all running processes. The script counts the number of lines output by this command to determine how many processes are running.
If the number of running processes exceeds the threshold, it logs an alert message.
Log File:

The script writes the health check report to /var/log/system_health_monitor.log, which can be configured to write elsewhere as needed.
Alerts:

If any of the metrics exceed their respective thresholds, the script logs an alert to the log file and prints it to the console.
